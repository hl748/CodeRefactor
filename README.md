## Getting Started

Edited a marketing website to use semantic code and organized sections by comments. Non-semantic tags (div) were replaced by semantic tags (section, footer, header, aside, main).


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
